# ML-Drowsiness-Detection
Monitors a driverâ€™s eyes in real time to assess if they are open or closed.

# How It's Built
Technologies Used: YOLOv5, OpenCV, PyTorch, Python, Jupyter Notebooks

This project performs real-time object detection using the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset to detect human faces and determine whether the eyes are open or closed. OpenCV is employed to capture real-time video frames, which are then processed by a YOLOv5-trained model for face and eye state detection.

The main functionality revolves around a loop that continuously captures frames from the webcam, runs detections on those frames, and renders the results. This loop remains active until the user presses 'q' to quit the application.

# Optimizations
Various optimizations were applied to ensure efficient and real-time performance. The frame capture and rendering processes were streamlined to eliminate lag, ensuring that real-time detections are displayed without delay. The model was also fine-tuned to achieve accurate detections while minimizing false positives/negatives. Efficient loading of assets and models was prioritized to ensure fast startup times and quick responsiveness.

# Lessons Learned
Balancing Accuracy and Performance: A key takeaway from this project was finding the right balance between detection accuracy and real-time performance. This required repeated iterations, testing, and tuning to ensure the model was both precise and responsive.

Integration Challenges: Combining different technologies such as OpenCV, PyTorch, and YOLOv5 posed integration challenges, underscoring the importance of understanding how various libraries and frameworks interact with each other.
